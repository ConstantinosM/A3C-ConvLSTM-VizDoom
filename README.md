# A3C-ConvLSTM-VizDoom
A3C Agent with ConvLSTM instead of LSTM playing VizDoom

Asynchronous Adantage Actor Critic [A3C](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01783) with Convoltional LSTM [ConvLSTM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04214). The code is from [Arthur's Juliani](https://github.com/awjuliani/DeepRL-Agents/blob/master/A3C-Doom.ipynb) notebook, which uses a fully connected LSTM. Here, instead, I use a Convolutional LSTM for experimentation purposes.

## Dependencies
- Python 3
- [VizDoom](http://vizdoom.cs.put.edu.pl/)
